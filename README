When you're getting ready for an exam, you want to be as prepared as possible.  When you're on your way to higher education, only the most direct and convenient study tools around can support you.

The GREat Vocab Tutor is a small application designed around studying for the GRE, providing flash cards that quizzes users on GRE vocabulary words and definitions.

The no-frills interface gets right to business and is instant accessible to anyone who has ever used paper and pencil flash cards.  In addition, the deck can be shuffled with a single touch.
